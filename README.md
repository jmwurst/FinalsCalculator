## Finals Calculator

Calculates the required final exam grades to get each letter grade for each class a user enters. The only necessary inputs are the class name, the current individual average, and the weight of the final as a percentage.

Issues:
 - Currently only supports .csv output.

Upcoming:
 - Clear fields button
 - Display data within the app
 - Make it an executable applet, if possible
